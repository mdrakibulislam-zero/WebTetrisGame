## What Have I Done:
I've made this tetris game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've used the CDN of font-awesome 5.15.4 from CDNJS for use the icons. I've also used jquery-3.3.1.js and animatelo-1.0.3.js for made this game.  

A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.

Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. As of 2020, Font Awesome was used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, placing Font Awesome in second place after Google Fonts.

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.

Animatelo is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. This is a porting to Web Animation API of the fabulous animate.css project.
